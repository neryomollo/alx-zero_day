My second README  in git ALX task 0x03 Git

Task 4 of ALX project "0x03 Git", named  "Collaboration: be up to date." Learning the git pull command by pulling changes made in github to this repo's README in my sandbox, then adding the command used (git pull) to a file named "up_to_date". Adding, committing, and pushing as usual.
